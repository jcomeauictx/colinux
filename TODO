 * Consoles:
   * If the console crashes, we need to recover somehow.
   * Make the consoles scrollable/resizable.
   * Address the font size portability issues with FLTK. Windows XP
     and Windows 2000 seem to choose different font sizes for the
     same font size in FLTK.
   * Add select, copy and paste to and from console and to and from
     host-environment (not so much mouse but using keys). Is now
     overcome by using SSH + putty, but that makes the console less
     usefull.
   * (optional) Support kermit or other 'telnet upload' protocol, to 
     upload files from the console.
   * Fix F10 in FLTK.

 * Installer:
   * Instruct the user to install Python for Windows, wxPython, and Python 
     Win32 extensions (or use py2exe).
   * The installer should add have an option to launch the configurator 
     when the installation finishes. 

 * Configurator:
   * Finish implementation of editing configuration files.
   * On the place block devices are configured, add the ability to 
     download the images from sourceforge on the.
   * On the place where network devices are configured, the configurator
     will enumerate either currently installed network adapter and TAP
     devices. More user friendliness could be added there to support the
     installation of one or more TAP devices.
   * Add nice wizards for the newbies.

 * Linux patch:
   * Make it impossible to compile in stuff like PCI with CONFIG_COOPERATIVE 
     enabled.   

 * Miscellaneous enhancements and fixes:
   * Lack of entropy - empty /dev/random
   * Make it work on PAE setups.
   * Make UML work on coLinux (SKAS included).
   * Make coLinux work on Windows NT 4 SP*.
   * Address all reported SMP issues.
   * The first search path for files specified in the XML, such as in 
     <image path="vmlinux" /> or block devices, should be in the directory 
     that contains the XML file.
   * Revise the argument parsing of the executables other than daemon, i.e,
     use the framework that the daemon uses.
   * When coLinux terminates with the reason of a restart (rather than 
     shutdown or kernel panic), let the daemon to restart itself (or maybe
     add support for it in the driver itself - but that requires more 
     changes. The behaviour of the daemon with regard the VM's termination
     could also be specified in the XML.
   * Use initrd as a method to provide kernel modules (instead of 
     modules.tar.gz)
   * Support to shutdown/suspend/resume (just!) coLinux so it becomes
     transportable between hosts.
   * Hostfs support
   * Import features from UML

 * conet: 
   * Allow to send/receive big packets (> 2900).
   * To fix: If the host connection is lost and returned, colinux-daemon will not 
     automatically return conet.
   * Possibly WinPCAP related, but a fix for support of wireless networks
     would be great.
   * Possibly WinPCAP related, compatibility with IPv6: IPv6 can be
     obtained but setting the IPv6 host address based on routeradvertisements
     is not working fine (I can see IPv6 traffic though in coLinux).
   * Tune performance (i.e reduce round trip time and increase bandwidth).

 * cobd:
   * Reimplement as asynchronous.

 * Root file system images: 
   * Fix and improve the Debian image.
     * Add ssh to it. the fact that we will end with the same sshd private keys
       all around the world is not a big issue :)
     * Fix the minor bits of editing needed as described on the Wiki.
     * Edit /etc/fstab to use extfs3
     * Etc-update and etc-upgrade up to today (a few packages but several Mo)
     * Remove some orphan package, like lilo? 
     * Add some 'obvious' packages that seems to be missing like ftp, strace. 
       the kind of software that we might need BEFORE being able to use apt-get.
     * And call it with a n+1 release name.
   * Post more images on SourceForge. Send me URLs of ready images. I will
     not accept images that are tied to specific coLinux releases.

 * Odd things to investigate:
   * Some iptables functionality not working? (see ML)
   * Spurious 'Floating Point Exception' with an athlon optimised vmlinux.

 * Cleanups:
   * Merge console into console-base.
   * Clear out some function naming brain damager and make more use
     of the 'static' keyword :).
   * The usual tidbits: comments, refactoring, etc.
