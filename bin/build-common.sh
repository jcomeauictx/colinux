# This is my script for building a complete cross-compiler toolchain.
# It is based partly on Ray Kelm's script, which in turn was built on
# Mo Dejong's script for doing the same, but with some added fixes.
# The intent with this script is to build a cross-compiled version
# of the current MinGW environment.
