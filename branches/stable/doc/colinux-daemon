The Cooperative Linux Daemon hosts the Linux virtual machine as one process under
the host operating system. Its command line syntax is as follows:

  colinux-daemon [-h] [-c config.xml] [-d]

      -h             Help screen
      -c config.xml  Specify configuration file
                     (default: colinux.default.xml)
      -d             Don't launch and attach a coLinux console on startup
      -t name        When spawning a console, this is the type of
                     console (e.g, nt, fltk, etc...)

The daemon spits out the kernel's printk() messages along with its own prints. It
also optionally launches the virtual VGA console, that can be used to interface
with the virtual machine.
