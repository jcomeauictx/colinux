        Notes about running the Cooperative Linux binaries on Windows
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

WARNING: 

Although Cooperative Linux may be actually useful on
some setups (e.g, stable setups), it is meant for testing purposes only, 
which means that running it may crash your Windows system.

PLEASE REPORT and read about problems on the colinux-devel@sourceforge.net 
mailing list.

NOTE: If upgrading, please backup or copy your current default.colinux.XML file
      before installing!

To run Cooperative Linux, please follow these instructions before trying to run 
anything.

1. Run the downloaded installer file to begin the installation. 
   
2. Choose an installation directory. It is better to choose c:\coLinux because
   this way you don't need to edit the configuration XML since the pathnames
   of block devices files are currently aboslute. However, note that any 
   directory should be acceptable.

3. Choose networking method(s) to install. Currently there are two choices:

	a. TAP driver - This method installs a virtual network adapter that can 
	then be either shared or bridged with a physical network connection. 
	Note that this requires Internet Connection Sharing or Bridging 
	(Windows XP or higher)or a 3rd party Internet connection sharing 
	application. See the Wiki at www.colinux.org for more information/help.

  	b. Bridging - This method allows the Cooperative Linux network 
	interface to directly interoperate with one of your built in networking 
	interfaces. You'll need to edit the configuration XML file to reflect 
	that type="bridged" and the 'name' parameter needs to be set to a 
	substring of the network adapter name that you will be bridging with. 
	Go the the network properties of your machine, and get the properties 
	of the adapter you will be bridging. Look at the text under the 
	'Connect Using' label. If it says, for example "Intel Pro Adapter",
	then you would set the 'name' in the XML file to: name="Intel Pro". 
	See the Wiki at www.colinux.org for more information/help.

4. Choose whether to download a root file system from the Cooperative Linux 
   sourceforge page. The installer will try to download directly in 
   the next step but if you experience any issues you can visit the
   Sourceforge page directly at:

   http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=98788&package_id=108058

   NOTE ABOUT DISK SPACE: Each image extracts to over 1GB (or more), so make 
   sure you   have enough  space there before you start downloading/extracting 
   it. If you are manually downloading, put the extracted file in the 
   installation directory. To unzip .bz2 files, you can use Winzip or 7-Zip 
   (or the bzip utilities in Cygwin, etc). The image MUST be extracted from 
   the .bz2 archive before use!   

5. Edit the XML file to point to whatever root file system you downloaded. 
   
6. The installation directory should include vmlinux, default.config.xml, the 
   supplied linux.sys driver, executables and dlls, and probably the root 
   filesystem image. Be sure to review the XML file for any additional 
   configuration that may be needed.

7. Run coLinux. The current directory should be the installation directory, 
   because that is where it will look for default.colinux.xml.

	a. Running as an service.  
		colinux-daemon.exe --install-service "Cooperative Linux"
		Also, to remove the service:
		colinux-daemon.exe --remove-service.
	   Then go to the Service Manager and start the "Cooperative Linux" 
	   service,
	   OR net start "Cooperative Linux"
	   Last, got to the installation directory and double-click on
	   	colinux-console-fltk.exe OR
		colinux-console-nt.exe		
	b. As an regular application. 
		colinux-daemon.exe
   
   The console window opens and you would see a Linux machine booting in 
   that window.

Post Installation
-----------------

You may wish to set up some post installation parameters, including increasing
the amount of memory allocated to Cooperative Linux, or adding a swap 
partition. See the Wiki at www.colinux.org for additional help on these tasks.


Command Line Parameters
------------------------

The following command line paramaters may be useful in operating Cooperative 
Linux.

	-a #
		Allows you to specify the instance of Coooperative Linux
		that you will be connecting to.

	-c filename.XML
		Allows you to choose a specific XML configuration file to use.

	-t consoletype
		Allows you to specify either the FLTK (default) or NT (-t nt) 
		console to use on startup. 

	--install-service servicename
		Allows you to install Cooperative Linux as a service. Also 
		use the -c parameter to specify your configuration file when 
		doing this. <servicename> is whatever you want it to be called.

	--remove-service servicename
		Allows you to remove the Cooperative Linux service. 

	--install-drvier
		This command to install the driver portion of Cooperative 
		Linux.
	
	--remove-driver
		This command will remove the driver portion of Cooperative
		Linux.


Common Problems
---------------

	"Unable to mount root fs"
		Generally this means that the root filesystem image is 
		missing, or was specified incorrectly.
