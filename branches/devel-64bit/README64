Branch for coLinux to build for Windows 64 bit
==============================================

#############################################################################
This is not ready. Some daemons and FLTK console can build.
To start FLTK, you needs to copy the file libgcc_s_sjlj-1.dll to Windows.
The file will find under bin/ in the MinGW-w64 ToolChain.
The driver linux.sys can load and the ioctl for "--status-driver" works.
Of curse, coLinux is NOT running now, because porting is not complete!
#############################################################################

First download current source from SVN:

	cd ...somewhere in your $HOME...
	svn co http://colinux.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/colinux/branches/devel-64bit devel-64bit

Run with ./configure --help to see all options:

	./configure --help

Mostly can run

	./configure --target=x86_64-w64-mingw32 \
		--downloaddir=$HOME/MinGW64/downloads \
		--prefix=$HOME/MinGW64/gcc445

If you have a working 32 bit environment, instead "configure" you can use your
settings. Only needs to add/change follow entries in your bin/user-build.cfg:

	COLINUX_HOST_OS="winnt"
	COLINUX_HOST_ARCH="x86_64"
	PREFIX=$HOME/MinGW64/gcc445

Run "make" will download toolchain and more files, and build all

	make

After changing the source, only needs to build coLinux daemons
(without rebuilding Linux kernel):

	make colinux

To send your changes back to coLinux project please create the patch with:

	svn diff >colinux.patch
