TODO:

- Locate for markers like "FIXME: W64:"
- PCAP fails.
  --> File colinux-bridged-net-daemon.exe excluded from build.
- Passage code fails totally.
  --> Code removed.
- libndis.a is missing for NT-kernel.
  --> Disabled in conet.c.
- Many warnings like
  "warning: cast from pointer to integer of different size"
- linux.sys was build and can load. But, nobody should try to run coLinux!!! This will crash all times.
- Find an official alternate for function RtlDosPathNameToNtPathName_U, or a way to do the same.
