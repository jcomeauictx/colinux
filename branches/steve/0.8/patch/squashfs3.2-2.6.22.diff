+	help
+	  Saying Y here includes support for SquashFS 3.2 (a Compressed Read-Only File
+	  System).  Squashfs is a highly compressed read-only filesystem for Linux.
+	  It uses zlib compression to compress both files, inodes and directories.
+	  Inodes in the system are very small and all blocks are packed to minimise
+	  data overhead. Block sizes greater than 4K are supported up to a maximum of 64K.
+	  SquashFS 3.1 supports 64 bit filesystems and files (larger than 4GB), full
+	  uid/gid information, hard links and timestamps.
+
+	  Squashfs is intended for general read-only filesystem use, for archival
+	  use (i.e. in cases where a .tar.gz file may be used), and in embedded
+	  systems where low overhead is needed.  Further information and filesystem tools
+	  are available from http://squashfs.sourceforge.net.
+
+	  If you want to compile this as a module ( = code which can be
+	  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want),
+	  say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.  The module
+	  will be called squashfs.  Note that the root file system (the one
+	  containing the directory /) cannot be compiled as a module.

+config SQUASHFS_FRAGMENT_CACHE_SIZE
+	int "Number of fragments cached" if SQUASHFS_EMBEDDED
+	depends on SQUASHFS
+	default "3"
+	help
+	  By default SquashFS caches the last 3 fragments read from
+	  the filesystem.  Increasing this amount may mean SquashFS
+	  has to re-read fragments less often from disk, at the expense
+	  of extra system memory.  Decreasing this amount will mean
+	  SquashFS uses less memory at the expense of extra reads from disk.
+
+	  Note there must be at least one cached fragment.  Anything
+	  much more than three will probably not make much difference.
+
+config SQUASHFS_VMALLOC
+	bool "Use Vmalloc rather than Kmalloc" if SQUASHFS_EMBEDDED
+	depends on SQUASHFS
+	default n
+	help
+	  By default SquashFS uses kmalloc to obtain fragment cache memory.
+	  Kmalloc memory is the standard kernel allocator, but it can fail
+	  on memory constrained systems.  Because of the way Vmalloc works,
+	  Vmalloc can succeed when kmalloc fails.  Specifying this option
+	  will make SquashFS always use Vmalloc to allocate the
+	  fragment cache memory.
