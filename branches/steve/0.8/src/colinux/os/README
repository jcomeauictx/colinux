This directory contains the host OS dependant code.

The OS independant headers of the OS dependent code are under 
the user and kernel subdirectories (for userspace and kernel space).
Common headers (for both userspace and kernel space) are in this
directory.

For every supported operating system, there is one directory 
that contains all its dependent code. The 'current' symlink points
to the currently selected operating system for the build.
