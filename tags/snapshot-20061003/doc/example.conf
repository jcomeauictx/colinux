#    colinux-daemon @example.conf
#
# Note that you can still prepend or append configuration and 
# boot parameters before and after '@', or you can use more 
# that one '@ to load several settings one after another.

# The default kernel
kernel=vmlinux

# File contains the root file system.
# Download and extract preconfigured file from SF "Images for 2.6".

# Swap device, should be an empty file with 128..512MB.

# Tell kernel the name of root device (mostly /dev/cobd0,
# /dev/cobd/0 on Gentoo)
# This parameter will be forward to Linux kernel.
